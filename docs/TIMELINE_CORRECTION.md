# Timeline Correction Guide

## Issue
Some documentation incorrectly lists timelines in months when the actual time periods are in days and weeks.

## Correct Timeline Format

### ‚ùå Incorrect (Months)
```
Phase 1: Core Improvements (Month 1-2)
Phase 2: Feature Enhancement (Month 3-4)  
Phase 3: Advanced Features (Month 5-8)
```

### ‚úÖ Correct (Weeks)
```
Phase 1: Core Improvements (Week 1-2)
Phase 2: Feature Enhancement (Week 3-4)
Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-8)
```

## Standard Timeline Structure

### Immediate (Week 1)
- Quick fixes and urgent improvements
- Bug fixes and critical updates
- Basic functionality enhancements

### Short Term (Week 2-3)
- Feature additions and improvements
- Performance optimizations
- User experience enhancements

### Medium Term (Week 4-6)
- Advanced features and integrations
- Scalability improvements
- Additional data sources

### Long Term (Week 7+)
- Major feature development
- Platform expansion
- Advanced analytics and ML features

## Examples of Correct Usage

### Project Phases
```
Phase 1: Core Improvements (Week 1-2)
Phase 2: Feature Enhancement (Week 3-4)  
Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-8)
```

### Development Sprints
```
Sprint 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
Sprint 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)
Sprint 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
Sprint 4: Polish & Launch (Week 7-8)
```

### Implementation Timeline
```
Week 1: Setup and basic functionality
Week 2: Core features implementation
Week 3: Testing and bug fixes
Week 4: Performance optimization
Week 5: User testing and feedback
Week 6: Final polish and deployment
```

## When to Use Different Time Units

### Use Days For:
- Bug fixes and hotfixes
- Quick updates and patches
- Emergency deployments

### Use Weeks For:
- Feature development phases
- Project milestones
- Development sprints

### Use Months For:
- Long-term strategic planning
- Annual roadmaps
- Major platform overhauls

## Template for Documentation Updates

When updating any documentation with timelines, use this format:

```markdown
## üéØ Timeline

### Immediate (Week 1)
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

### Short Term (Week 2-3)  
- [ ] Task 3
- [ ] Task 4

### Medium Term (Week 4-6)
- [ ] Task 5
- [ ] Task 6

### Long Term (Week 7+)
- [ ] Task 7
- [ ] Task 8
```

**Note**: Always verify that timeline units match the actual time periods being described. If a project phase takes 2 weeks, it should be listed as "Week 1-2", not "Month 1-2".
