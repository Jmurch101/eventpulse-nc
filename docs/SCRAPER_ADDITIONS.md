### Key Features
- **Realistic Event Data**: Events reflect actual types of meetings and activities
- **Proper Geocoding**: Accurate latitude/longitude for Triangle locations
- **Consistent Format**: Follows existing EventPulse NC data structure
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive comments and documentation
